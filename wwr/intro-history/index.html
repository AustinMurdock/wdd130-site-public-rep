                        <p>During an expidition through indiginous lands, John S. River discovered a winding flow through the mountains, which he classified as the first river. This river is still held in the British Museum today.</p>

                        <p>Upon closer inspection, a team of scientists have discovered that the "winding flow" movement of rivers is due to their composition of approximately 100% water. Rivers retain their name in honor of John S. River's contribution to the British Museum.</p>

                        <p>After the end of WW1, the United States owned a surplus of battleships that saw little use for many years. Civillians independently discovered that without the "battle", these battleships could still be used as "ships", and thus sailed smoothly down rivers. The heavy use of turrets also disrupted the natural flow of rivers, which redefined them as water, and churned the surface to appear white.</p>

                        <h2>1940s - USA Joins WW2: Battleship Shortage</h2>
                        <p>After the reposession of civillian battleships by the U.S. Government, other options were sought out for river-sailing ships. It turns out that the battleships' safety rafts were determined unnecessary for war. Though less stable in certain rivers, and with an upsetting lack of turrets, the resource-scarce environment of WW2 forced the end of whitewater battleshipping and resulted in the rise of whitewater rafting.</p>

                        <h2>1960s - Color Invented</h2>
                        <p>When color was invented, water was assigned to be blue due to the whims of photographers, much to the annoyance of whitewater rafting enthusiasts. Most refuse to acknowledge the names of "colorwater rafting" or "bluewater rafting", including the creators of this site.
                        <br>Whitewater rafting remains mostly unchanged to this day, as the authors of this page don't feel like writing any more history at this time.</p>
