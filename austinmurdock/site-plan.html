            </h2>
            <h3>Home page</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Purpose:</strong> As this site is intended for employers, the main page should create a brief impression of my skills and experience, similar to a resume. Displaying my completed projects is the main difference between this site and a resume, so links to the subpages (projects and info) will also be a main feature.
                <br><strong>Possible Text:</strong> "Computer Science student at Brigham Young University - Idaho / Experience: / Not much at the moment / Skills: / Python, Erlang, HTML, CSS, C#".
                <br> Links to Projects and About pages.
            </p>
            <p>Images for the Home page</p>

            </ul>
            <h3>Projects</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Purpose:</strong> This page will display any of my projects that demonstrate relevant skills to employers. As the main feature, it should be especially clean and easy to navigate. Each project, likely with an image that represents the project as an icon, should include a description of the projects purpose and a reflection on what was learned. Individual links to the projects' Github repositories or specialized sites should be included if available.
                <br><strong>Possible Text:</strong> For now, this page will mainly include headings and project titles, with placeholder text for most of the detailed descriptions.

            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Purpose:</strong> This page will feature a more detailed description of the purpose of the site and who I am, as I have almost no information available on social media. It may also include a contact form and a download link for my actual resume.
                <br><strong>Possible Text:</strong> "Hi, I'm Austin Murdock, currently studying Computer Science at Brigham Young University - Idaho. I currently have no research papers, degrees, or certificates. My relevant experience is very limited, but I work well with others, I think, probably. If you knew where I lived, you would likely be able to find me not eating watermelon rinds, or <strike>playing</strike> studying video games."
                <br>Listed below will be links to my Github, Linkedin, and Email, with a form for sending a message, and a link to open a pdf of my resume.
